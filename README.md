# 🌸 IRIS Detection using K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

This project demonstrates how to implement the **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** algorithm **from scratch** using the famous **Iris dataset**.  
It is designed for beginners who want to understand the core logic behind one of the simplest machine learning algorithms — without using any ML libraries like scikit-learn.
